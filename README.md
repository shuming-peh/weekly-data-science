# Introduction to Data Science

## Course Description
This course is split into 2 parts:
1. Mathematical and statistical foundation
1. Derivation of how each algorithm works
	- How each algorithm works, and what are important to the algorithm
	- The advantages and limits of each algorithm

This course covers the mathematical basics and concepts (and derivation) of what goes behind each algorithm and provide a sound foundation and understanding of what each model or algorithm does. The notions of calculus, mathematical theories and assumptions are explained. These notions then form the bases and build up to each algorithm that will be taught in this course.

## Learning Objectives 
By the end of this course, you will be able to:
- Use techniques and theorems from calculus to solve basic problems, such as optimization and functional approximation
- Use the concepts taught to read, appreciate and understand foundational Machine Learning literature
- Use the concepts taught to apply to and solve real world problems using data science (or mathematics/statistics)

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge
No pre-requisite knowledge is required, everything will be covered in class. Even if you have no knowledge in calculus, it will be re-taught in class.

## Class Timings
Every Saturday, 1030 â€“ 1330 (ish)
39 Robinson Road, Level 9, Potala
