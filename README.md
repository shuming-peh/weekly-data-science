# Introduction to Data Science

Course Description
This course is split into 2 parts:
1. Mathematical and statistical foundation
1. Derivation of how each algorithm works
	- How each algorithm works, and what are important to the algorithm
	- The advantages and limits of each algorithm

This course covers the mathematical basics and concepts (and derivation) of what goes behind each algorithm and provide a sound foundation and understanding of what each model or algorithm does. The notions of calculus, mathematical theories and assumptions are explained. These notions then form the bases and build up to each algorithm that will be taught in this course.
